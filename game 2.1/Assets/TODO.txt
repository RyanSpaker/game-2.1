bugs:
momentum conserved even when not sprinting
crouch double jump
frictionless walls camera isssue
frctionless wall intersections

needs implementing:
sliding
3 dimensional frictionless walls
momentum dragging (make it so that you can slowly turn, and keep all momentum)
grapple ?
double jump ?
dash (move quickly to one side, then slow down, gives a small speed bost after the dash)
level objects: jump pad, boost pad, bounce wall
an actually fleshed out map?
ai that chases the player ? (could start out as just a floating orb that constantly follows the player))
